# Semantic Release Plugin for Microsoft Teams

> Forked from here https://github.com/wagaru/semantic-release-teams and updated.
>
> Extended with ideas from https://github.com/yllieth/semantic-release-ms-teams.
>
> If you do not want to use the plugin, but still want to use these presets you can set the environment variable `TEAMS_WEBHOOK_DISABLED` to `true`. This will skip the steps.
