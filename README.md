### [MS Teams](./plugins/ms-teams/README.md)

This was forked from https://github.com/wagaru/semantic-release-teams and updated.

### Recommendation

Based on your git knowledge and application or package release cycle, different configurations might be best suited for you:

#### Package and advanced Git knowledge (rebasing, branching)

If you are an advanced git user with rebasing and branching knowledge and maintain an npm or dotnet package, the configurations [.releaserc.full.json](./presets/.releaserc.full.json) or [.releaserc.nuget.json](./presets/.releaserc.nuget.json) might be beneficial for you.\
They provide support for normal version publishing, pre-releases and maintenance handling.\
Branches:
- `main`: normal version publishing
- `dev`: beta releases
- `alpha`: alpha releases
- `N.x.x`: maintenance handling (e.g. 1.x.x handles all version 1 maintenance releases)

#### Package with basic Git knowledge

If you have basic git knowledge and maintain an npm or dotnet package, the configurations [.releaserc.main-full.json](./presets/.releaserc.main-full.json) or [.releaserc.main-nuget.json](./presets/.releaserc.main-nuget.json) might be beneficial for you.\
They provide support for normal version publishing on branch `main`.

#### Application development

If you mainain an application you can check the configurations with `main` or `dev` in the name. They define the branch the release will be triggered.\
Most suitable should be the `dev` handling. This means you develop and release on this branch and merge into `main` for manual deployment.

### Usage

Add it to your .releaserc.json:
```json
{
  "extends": "semantic-release-presets/presets/.releaserc.full.json"
}
```
